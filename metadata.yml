Title: Gram-negative activity as a permeability proxy
Description: Gram-negative and gram-positive MIC data from CoADD was used to 
  train a Chemprop model that predicts activity against Escherichia coli 
  (gram-negative) with respect to Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive). Active 
  compounds in both pathogens were labeled as permeable, whereas inactive 
  compounds in gram-negative but active in gram-positive were labeled as 
  impermeable.
Deployment:
  - Local

Source Type: External
Task: Annotation
Subtask: Activity prediction
Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
  - Score
Output Dimension: 1
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: Higher score indicates higher likelihood of permeability 
  gram-negative activity, understood as a proxy for permeability.
