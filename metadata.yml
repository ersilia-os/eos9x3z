Title: Gram-negative activity as a permeability proxy
Description: Gram-negative and gram-positive MIC data from CoADD was used to train
  a Chemprop model that predicts activity against Escherichia coli (gram-negative)
  with respect to Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive). Active compounds in both
  pathogens were labeled as permeable, whereas inactive compounds in gram-negative
  but active in gram-positive were labeled as impermeable.

Output:
- Score
Output Dimension: 1
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: Higher score indicates higher likelihood of permeability gram-negative activity, understood as a proxy for permeability.
